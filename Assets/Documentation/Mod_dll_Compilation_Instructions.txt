Compiling dlls:

Create a new project in Visual Studio of type "Class Library"
Reference as many scripts from the [Location of the game.exe]/Bullet Hell Engine_Data/Managed as possible (TODO: Figure out which dll holds my scripts, and which scripts are invalid)
Build the project with your class

When built, locate the scripts directly related to your project and move them to your Mod's folder within the game's Mods folder


*FAILED*
Build in a better place:
1. Right click the project icon in the Solution Explorer
2. Go to Properties then select Build->Output
3. Change base output path to your mod's folder within the game's Mods folder
4. Profit!
